# Kitty-BadgeGenerator

BadgeGenerator is a very simple program allowing you to batch-generate personalised event badges.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases tab and run the exe.

## Usage

Put the badge template (PNG) in the 'badgetemplate' folder, put a range of icons (JPG or PNG, 1000x1000) in the 'badgeimages' folder.
You can put custom fonts in .ttf format in program folder, select them during runtime.

## Disclaimer

The program is in very early stages of development, this is only a prototype. For now, any change to the image position has to be done manually in the code.
